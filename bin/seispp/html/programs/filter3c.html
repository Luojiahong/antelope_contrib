    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <p>filter3c filter_specification &lt; in &gt; out [-v --help
      -binary]<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
    Applies a time invariant filter to one or more
    ThreeComponentEnsembles stored in the serialized input file read
    from stdin.&nbsp; Writes the filtered data to stdout.<br>
    <br>
    Filtering is implemented with the Antelope recursive filters as
    defined in man wffil(3).&nbsp;&nbsp; The required argument,
    filter_specification, is a string that defines their suite of
    filters as used by wffil.&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g. INT is integration and
    "BW 1.0 5 15.0 5" is a Butterworth bandpass filter with 5 poles on
    each end of the pass band and corner frequencies of 1.0 and 15.0
    Hz.&nbsp; <br>
    <h3>Options:</h3>
    <h3> </h3>
    -binary - switch to binary input and output (default is text data)<br>
    --help - print the usage message<br>
    -v - send some messages to stderr<br>
